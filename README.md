# CSS - Space Engineers

Collection of casual scripts (WIP).



## Build with MDK-SE
(Malware's Development Kit for SE)

_A toolkit to help with ingame script (programmable block) development for Keen Software House's space sandbox Space Engineers. It helps you create a ready-to-code project for writing ingame scripts, and provides an analyzer which warns you if you're trying to use something that is not allowed in Space Engineers._
